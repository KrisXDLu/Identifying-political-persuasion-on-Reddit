36, 45, 66, 82, 103 are all taken out because the features are very significant to the analysis.
The p values are all zero because it is too small when the set is small. The more data given the the better the accuracy
liwc_OtherP, liwc_affect, liwc_cogproc, liwc_health, liwc_ppron because those features are more relevent to the data I got.
